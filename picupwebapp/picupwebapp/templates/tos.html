</h2>
<p>

Your use of such third party applications, websites, and services is governed by that partyâ€™s own terms of service or privacy policies.

<p>
When you create an account, you may use any name (real, fake or otherwise) for other users to see. However, if you create a "parody" account of a real living person, you must clearly label your account as such. Accounts that are not clearly marked as such and that impersonate other people without permission can be deleted without warning.
</p>
<p>
When you create an account you also agree to maintain the security of your password and accept all risks of unauthorized access to your account data and any other information you provide to <strong>PicUp It</strong>.
</p>
<p>
If you discover or suspect any Service security breaches, please let us know as soon as possible. For security holes in the software itself, please contact <a href="mailto:security@picup.it">the developers directly</a>.
